      "A: Yes! We'll cover some linear algebra in the course, but in general, there will be very few formulas, mostly code.\n",
      "Here are some interesting videos covering linear algebra that you can already watch: ML Zoomcamp 1.8 - Linear Algebra Refresher from Alexey Grigorev or the excellent playlist from 3Blue1Brown Vectors | Chapter 1, Essence of linear algebra. Never hesitate to ask the community for help if you have any question.\n",

      "Some homework(s) asks for specific python library versions.\n",
      "Answers may not match in MCQ options if using different languages other than Python 3.10 (the recommended version for 2023 cohort)\n",
      "And as for midterms/capstones, your peer-reviewers may not know these other languages. Do you want to be penalized for others not knowing these other languages?\n",

      "Nonetheless, it might be useful for you to rewatch the video, or even watch videos/lectures/notes by other people on this topic, as the ROC AUC is one of the most important metrics used in Binary Classification models.\n",
